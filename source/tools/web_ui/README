# CoGaDB Web UI #
#################

This is a simply interactive interface to query CoGaDB via its SQL interface. 
It is meant for demonstration purposes only, do NOT use it for connections over the network 
as the communication is not encrypted!

#########
# Setup #
#########

For this scenario, we need to setup CoGaDB as a database server process and we need a web server such as Apache to
render the website. In the following, we use Apache to setup the web interface.

# CoGaDB #
##########

You need to configure CoGaDB to use the CSV output format and that it listens on port 8000 for incoming connections.
Furthermore, you need to install BSD netcat, which serves as a client.

Here is a minimal set of coga script commands for this:

   setdevice cpu
   set path_to_database=PATH_TO_YOUR_DATABASE
   loaddatabase
   set result_output_format=csv
   set print_query_plan=false
   listen 8000

# Apache (Webserver) #
######################

0. Install Apache and configure it. Here is a minimal Apache configuration:
   <VirtualHost *:80>
           ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
           DocumentRoot /var/www/html/

           <Directory "/var/www/html/">
              Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews +Includes
              AllowOverride None
              Order allow,deny
              allow from all
           </Directory>

           ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
           CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>

1. Create a new folder within the web server's document root, e.g., /var/www/html/web_ui.

2. Make sure that Apache has write access to that folder: 'chown www-data web_ui'

3. Within the web UI folder, create symbolic links to all files in the web UI directory of your CoGaDB source directory:
   'ln -s /home/<your_name>/gpudbms/cogadb/web_ui/* .'

4. Well done! Now visit http://localhost/web_ui/ and enjoy the CoGaDB web interface.
